in rough order of importance

1. do the the artificial field plots which clearly show how they work
	--> 1 robot, 2 obstacles type of plot for that purpose
	--> of course there will be (at least) one big and sexy animation
		of it in action for a whole simulation (at the very least because
		it's so damn pretty)

2. figure out what to change to make the work as indended (99% sure
it's just down to signs, everything is defined with robot-something radii-vectors,
just make sure that the radial fields have the appropriate directions and
that the strength are reasonable)

3. come up with cheap hack which limits total field stregth when 2 obstackles 
overlap:
	3.1. draw picture, do geometry, do few sample calcs and call it day if it 
		 it checks out on 
	3.2. find out how to efficiently indentify overlapping obstacles
		---> since they don't move you need to do that before you even run the sim,
			 it's all gucci if you don't need to recalculate that all the time
	3.3 pretend they won't form a closed loops
