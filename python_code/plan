PREPARE FOR PREZ
-------------
create plots reprezenting every concept and also put in benchmarks there
- motion
- artificial potential fields
- influence of obstacles
- bla you know what has been done just plot it in a fun way

high-level
----------
3. implement all reasonable algorithms (the benchmarks too, but that's not a priority rn)
4. put all of them in various situations (various sizes, n of items, floor layouts etc)
5. reasses the situation again



more specific
-------------
1. finalize the environment:
	---> create the outer and inner walls (via variuos functions)
	---> generate new goals on the fly.
====> MAKE STORIES AND APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTS
thing is, these walls will have to do the following:
1) be impassable (which also needs to be dealt with when initializing)
2) block vision. this would not be a problem in a proper simulation environment,
   but here we'll need to deal with that manually
3) generate artificial force fields which leads to them being avoided


3.	
	d) combinations of above
		===> state machine swithing between modes 
			 based on various criteria
				===> you can then also optimize the switching thresholds with the GA
				===> or make a neural network learn how to tune params based on data

4. do both warehouse and truffle searching and whatever. have random env, changing env, sparse, dense,...

5. hope to god this happens soon and shit works
