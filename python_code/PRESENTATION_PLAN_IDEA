1st slide - front page
======================

2nd slide - introduction to the introduction: the research question
==================================================================
the research question
----------------------
theoretical:
"Can we apply apply knowleadge about active brownian swimmers 
and other random walkers to create an efficient search/ 
area coverage maximizing control algorithm for a swarm of
simple robots?"

practical:
"There are many possible application for swarms of small, low-powered
robots. We want to produce a simple simulation to be used as "proof of concept"
for the above idea for one such application."


3rd slide - short video of final simulation (15-20secs)
=======================================================


4th slide - more detailed motivation for theory
===============================================
- active brownian motion cleary works for active microswimmers
---> giovanni reference
- levy flights are used by various animal species and
since they're still around clearly there's merit to this
----> go on wiki for for 'levy flight foraging hypothesis',
scroll, take some refs from there
- ants and bees are individually dumb and almost blind,
but their individual simplicity does not prevent them
from reaching efficient complex solutions
- brownian motion is good for covering a smaller area
---> but we won't go into the math here 'cos of time constraints



5th slide - more detailed motivation for the applications
========================================================
THE FOLLOWING POINTS ARE ESSENTIAL
we are tackling the following formulation - 
we want to automate something with robots.
that something is:
1. in an (effectively) unknown environment
2. the environment has to be explored to achieve that something

the following points are optional (but make our approach more 
favourable over others)
3. the environment lacks
energy infrastructure (ocean floor, mars, siberia, etc)
4. the environment is complex (a forest, damaged buiding, etc)

our approach is the following
use many simple, small, low powered robots to accomplish 
the goal via their emergent behaviour

examples:
- search and rescue
- collecting cigarette butts in public areas (closest to our model)
- gathering data for scientific purposes
- monitoring/ searching for pollution
- surveillance (but i'd prefer we skip that one lel)

6th slide - roadmap to the final algorithm
=========================================
1. explain robot and world model physically
2. explain robot software architecture
3. explain types of motion
4. explain artificial potential fields
5. explain the robotic algorithm 
6. explain next future step: adding logic for self-adaptivity
based on the environment observation, then optimize
the governing parameters with the genetic alg and/or
artificial network techniques


7th slide - "physics"
=====================
just a screenshot of the animation, 
then say it's 2d continuous and it's all circles


8th slide - 
=========
- sample (small and simple) finite state machine graph 
to explain what that is


9-11th slides - animations + plots of 3 types of random motion
=============================================================
- also stick a formula on the screen just to have it there
so that it looks more #serious


12th slide - artificial potential fields
=======================================
- we're not using dynamics (no masses or accelerations, just
kinematics) 'cos it complicates matters and this is just proof of concept 
- 4 animations:
1) only robots, shows dispersion
2) only 1/few robot without noise and obstacles to show operating principle
3) add items into the mix just for fun (it's off in this version of
the application as it's better to turn off obstacle forces when picking up
items (which are in line of sight anyway. in data collecting apps, you don't
pick items and then item forces would be super super important)
4) show example when this fails hard to show that you need to 
do more work to get quality super-diffusive behaviour (local minima problem)


13th slide - the algorithm
==========================
- finite state machine graph of the final version
---> i'll do it in tikz 'cos it will take 2mins and it will
be a slick-looking rasterized pdf (unless the pdf is a problem, 
in which case let's just take an hd screenshot)



14th slide - fancy optimization to achieve self-adaptivity
===========================================================
- just boring bullets stating what's to come (max 15 words tho)
- but then throw in a meme which conveys that we didn't do that haha
stay tuned fellas

15th slide - roadmap to tests
=============================
1) average msd for various random walk parameters
both with just robots roaming and with the whole sim
2) explain the testing strategy
3&4) show plots & explain and discuss results



so yeah...
now enter the problematic territory

how to test?
-> idea: have "standard model" then tune 1 parameter at a time
and show how stuff changes


how what changes?
----------------
---> performance metrics:
a) number of items collected
b) number of robots successfully returned to base
c) percentage of covered area (without the obstacles obviously)
d) n of times the robots collided with other robots and/or obstacles


but what is a standard model? 
-----------------------------
--> multiple different models;
this amount to finding cases of interesting combinations of independent
variables in specific types of environments. 
then fix all but one of them, change the unfixed one, see what happens.
will this cover all possible parameters? of course not.
the GA is supposed to be used to find good parameter combinations
for specific types of environments.
idk if we'll get to use it given the time and date, but one can hope.
however, we still need to show what changes when you change a parameter.
bottom line: the more we get to do the better on this front

so what type of environments are we talking about?
---------------------------------------------------
- porous environemnt from giovanni paper 
- rectangular arena (to emulate building environment)
repeat the below ones for different obstacle sizes
- sparse environment
- normal cluttering level
- highly clusterred 
if (time-wise) possible generate these enviroments, if not roll with like 2-4
of premade ones. the last 3 are already generated.



which parameters are to be used as independent variables?
---------------------------------------------------------
as much as possible
the number of robots and force and torque coefficients.
state transitions parameters won't be in game rn,
that's the self-tunability part to be developed later


we ran the sims, got the data, now what?
----------------------------------------
combine the things below into fun graphs
and then have slides with these graphs
TODO create and select these graphs
