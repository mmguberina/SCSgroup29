\section{Discussion}

Proposal of things to mention: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item How the switching works (well or not well?) 
    \item With and without artificial potential fields
    \item Artificial potential fields on the items
    \item Optimization (if we do that)
    \item Impact of different geometries? 
    \item Compare results to similar studies? 
\end{itemize}
