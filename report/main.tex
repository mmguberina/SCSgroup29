%% Assignment text: 
% The report should be written in RevTex 4.2 (see https://journals.aps.org/revtex (Links to an external site.)), using the format of Physical Review X with a limit of 8 pages in double-column reprint format (including pictures and references). If needed, you can have an extra document containing an unlimited amount of Supplementary Materials.

% Structure your report like a scientific article, with an abstract summarising the rationale and results of the project; an introduction shortly explaining its background and motivating why the question is interesting; methods and/or results section(s) describing your model and what you do with it; a discussion section; and ending with a conclusion. Put some work into the discussion and conclusion sections. This is where you demonstrate that you truly understand the implications of your work, including shortcomings and uncertainties. It is important that the discussion does not fall out as a simple summary of what the figures show.
